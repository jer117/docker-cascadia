Components of Cascadia

Cascadia is a platform built to understand and incentivize positive consumer behavior. As trailblazers of the neo-cybernetic movement, we're committed to building innovative solutions to web3's problems via social and artificial intelligence. Cascadia seeks to create a unique value proposition by diving deeper than the consensus layer, to explore emergent behaviors and incentive alignment within complex adaptive systems.

Cascadia's anticipated success can be attributed to the commitment of more than five hundred global contributors. We're proud of our talented and diverse community and are confident that together, we'll redefine what's possible with blockchain technology.
